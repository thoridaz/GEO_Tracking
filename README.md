# GEO_Tracking
This application is being built as part of a university project.
All the files related to building this project will be included in here.
The scope of it, is to have multiple cheap commercial GPS trackers that are easily obtainable, sending location information updates through the mobile 3G/4G-LTE network (data) and over the internet to the central virtual server. There, a python tcp server instance will be running, being able to receive multiple packets at a time, parse them and insert them into a MySQL database running on the same virtual machine.
On the same virtual server, a web server will be running, distributing a responsive web application built in HTML with CSS and JS.
Through this application, both the users and the administrators will be able to login after authenticating using their login, through their web browser.
In the following pages, users will be able to select from their assigned trackers and depict their locations on a Google Map for the selected period of time.
